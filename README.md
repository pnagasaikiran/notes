# Security-Researcher

This is my notebook about stuff related to cybersecurity & penetration testing.

I use u try to write down how some things work and not works , but at the same time I want to use a reference book to find commands and things I just can't remember. I have copy-paste ready commands that are useful to ready to use and practice. Simple and easy commands to make work easy and life beautiful. 

Also, this notebook is just a collection of cyber-stuff that is available on the web. I am just a simple researcher. I have tried to include a reference section to show where I found some techniques its useful to use in pentesting. This notebook is trying to give something back to the infosec community and I hope it can be useful to someone.

You can read this book on [https://xapax.gitbooks.io/security/content/](https://xapax.gitbooks.io/security/content/). If you feel like contributing, or just forking it, you can do that from its github repo here: [https://github.com/xapax/security](https://github.com/xapax/security). If you feel like this is a good start, but you want to add and remove things and just make it yours you can just fork it and do whatever you want with it.

## Find practical examples

If you read about a vulnerability that you want to know more about I can really recommend searching for in on HackerOne via google. It is a good way to find real life examples of vulnerabilities.

Here is an example of such a search:

```
site:hackerone.com sql-injection
```

## Disclaimers

Sometimes the line isn't very clear between the chapters. Some actions might be considered part of the vulnerability analysis-phase, but it could also but considered part of the recon-phase. It is what it is.

These chapters are written sporadically with a lot of stuff missing. I just add stuff wherever whenever. Also, things might not be accurate, I might have misunderstood something or misused a tool. So don't trust me or this book for any accuracy.
